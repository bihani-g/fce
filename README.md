# Calibration Estimation Using Fuzzy Binning

## About fuzzy-binning

Estimation of calibration error in neural networks is done using metrics based on crisp-binning of prediction probabilities such as ECE and MCE. These metrics are vulnerable to the leftward-skew in model prediction probabilities. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Calibration Error (FCE) that utilizes a fuzzy binning approach. Using FCE reduces the impact of probability skew and provides a tighter estimate when measuring calibration error.

This repository contains code and implementation for FCE, as described in the paper "Calibration Estimation Using Fuzzy Binning".
